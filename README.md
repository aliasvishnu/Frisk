Frisk
=====
Software that will analyse a song, rename and fill missing metadata.

Frisk assumes that the song name is "song.mp3".
The song must be present in the project folder.
It will give the Title, Artist and Length of the track in output.txt.
It doesn't fill the metadata just yet, just writes it to output.txt.

How to use
==========
Take any song you want to find info about. Place it in the project directory. 
Rename it as song.mp3. Even if it is of another audio format.


Drawbacks
=========

The software's is limited to MusicBrainz database. 
Fetches only artist and track name, as of now.
